    "I am someone who *loves* to music. One of my favorite genres to listen to is hip-hop/rap because of, in some cases, the focus on lyricism. \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been less of a focus in this regard, leading some fans of \"true hip-hop\" to look down upon the musicians currently in the spotlight. Part of the criticism of modern rap is how forgettable the lyrics and songs are due to their simplistic nature. \n",

    "While learning about *recurrent neural networks* (RNNs)I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMudJXhsUpY) by Laurence Moroney explaining how AI can be used to generate poetry after training upon a corpus of Irish poems. This sparked an idea to try and do the same with a modern song lyrics. I specifically decided to choose rap because of my familiarity with the genre and thinking that the songs may have more words since the artists are not singing (most of the time).\n",
