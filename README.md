# Rap_Generator
RNN for generating rap lyrics by Darius Fuller
 
## Background
I am someone who *loves* to music. One of my favorite genres to listen to is hip-hop/rap because of, in most cases, the focus on lyricism. 

In recent years, with the popularity of songs classified as "[mumble rap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_rap)" there has been less of a focus in this regard, leading some fans of "true hip-hop" to look down upon the musicians currently in the spotlight. Part of the criticism of modern rap can often center around how forgettable the lyrics and songs are due to their simplistic nature. 

While learning about *recurrent neural networks* (RNNs)I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMudJXhsUpY) by Laurence Moroney explaining how AI can be used to generate poetry after training upon a corpus of Irish poems. This sparked an idea to try and do the same with modern rap lyrics. I specifically decided to choose this genre because of my familiarity with it and thinking that the songs may be more wordy since the artists often are not singing any melodies.
